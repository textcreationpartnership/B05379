            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE remembrance of having been under the protection of your Royal Family above 2000 Years, of having been preserved by their Valour, from the sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to which others were so often reduced, and of having received from their Bounty the Lands we possess, hath been very much refreshed and renewed by having Your Royal Brother among us, in whom we have seen that moderation of Spirit, and equality of Justice that is remarkable in Your Sacred Race, and has raised in us a just abhorrence of these seditious Persons and pernicious Principles, which would lead us back into those dreadful Confusions which grew up by degrees from tumultuary Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Reformation and Parliament, to a Rebellion that in the last Age destroyed both, and which must do so still, since all who think that Subjects should direct their King, design nothing in effect but to be Kings themselves; The Convictions of all which did prevail so far with all Degrees of Persons, and with Persons of all Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions here, that it has been easily observed that our Nobility and Gentry of both Sexes attended their Royal Highnesses with much joy and assiduity, expressing in all their Confluences great respect and satisfaction, that even the most malicious abstained from all manner of rebellious Risings or undutiful Speeches: No breach of the Peace, no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, no Pasquil having been ever discovered during his abode here; so that this too short time has been the most peaceable and serene part of our life, and the happiest days we ever saw, except your Majesties miraculous Restauration. And now that Your Majesty has thought fit to have him near Your own Person, we hope that the great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess he has had in understanding both Men and Business among us, by his easie access and constant application, will enable him to inform Your Majesty of our Affairs and Interests with which we trust him, much more then we can this or any other Papers that we can send you. His Countenance has much encouraged the Orthodox Clargy without being grievous to such other Protestants as differ from them: He has quieted our <hi>Highland</hi> Eruptions, without encouraging any opposition to Law, of which he told us he would be always most exactly careful, as being the common tye as well as security of King and People, and he has both by his Example and Discourse recommended so to us Loyalty to Your Majesty as our only National Interest, and moderation to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the only mean to fortifie and unite us against the undermining Designs of such as would infallibly make us Slaves, as they did formerly: That we hope these Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions shall not wear out whilest we live, who have been so happy as to know him at this time, and for which happiness we can make Your Majesty no other return, save to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure You, That with our Hearts, our Lives, and our Fortunes, we will maintain Your Sacred Majesty and Your Royal Successors in the ordinary degrees of Succession according to their unalterable right of Blood, which You and they derive only from God Almighty whom You represent, and to wish that his Royal Highness may meet every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where that satisfaction and tranquility he has occasioned, and that kindness and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which his Merit has raised in</hi>
